Triangulating Polygons
======================

Challenge:
----------
Attached is the puzzle to be solved in code. The challenge is to show whether a
solution exists according to the second-last paragraph, “Can you color the
inside dots so as to create two complete triangles and no more?”, using the
as-drawn triangulation. The last paragraph allows different triangulations
within the same border. That is out of scope for the challenge.

Solution:
---------
The solution works by finding candidates for the two proper triangles,
then sees if it can colour the other triangles without making a third
proper triangle. If it cannot fill the polygon, there is no solution

    generate triangles
    for list of triangles
        find two possible proper triangles
        try and fill the polygon without making more proper triangles
        if polygon is filled
            return solution exists
    return no solution

Resources:
----------
Python3 Documentation

The solution was implemented on Ubuntu using Python3 and the Atom text editor.

Time:
-----
approximately 15-16 hours to complete

Instalation Instructions:
--------------------------
Requires a python interpreter.

To run the solution navigate to the file and enter
    python3 triangulatingPolygons.py

To run the unit tests navigate to the file and enter
    python3 triangulatingPolygons.py -t

Regrets:
--------
I wish that I had requested a little more time so that I could have tested more
and generated more puzzles to properly test my solution. If I had more time
or could start over, I would look into applying constraint value problem 
techniques, because I believe that this challenge can be classified as a 
constraint value problem
