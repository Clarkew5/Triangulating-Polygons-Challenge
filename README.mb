Triangulating Polygons
======================

Challenge:
----------
Attached is the puzzle to be solved in code. The challenge is to show whether a
solution exists according to the second-last paragraph, “Can you color the
inside dots so as to create two complete triangles and no more?”, using the
as-drawn triangulation. The last paragraph allows different triangulations
within the same border. That is out of scope for the challenge.

Solution:
---------
